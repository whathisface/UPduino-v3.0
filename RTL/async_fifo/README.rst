Asynchronous dual clock FIFO
============================

Overview
--------

This repository stores a verilog description of dual clock FIFO. A FIFO is
a convinient circuit to exchange data between two clock domains. It manages 
the RAM addressing internally, the clock domain crossing and informs the user 
of the FIFO fillness with "full" and "empty" flags.

It is widely inspired by the excellent article from Clifford Cummings,
`Simulation and Synthesis Techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design 
<http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf>`_

The simulation testcases available use `Icarus Verilog <http://iverilog.icarus.com>`_
and `SVUT <https://github.com/ThotIP/svut>`_ tool to run the tests.
